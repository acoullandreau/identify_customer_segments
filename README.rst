====================================================
Identify Customer Segments - Udacity DSND project 3
====================================================


-----------------------
Purpose of this project
-----------------------

As part of the UDACITY Data Scientist Nanodegree, I worked on an **unsupervised learning** project. The purpose of this project was to identify population segments for a mail-order sales company in Germany - to target marketing campaigns.
We were guided through the method, and the Jupyter notebook of this repository traces back each step and result.

In this repository, you will find:

- A Jupyter notebook with all the details of the approach and the code executed as well as the results
- An html version of the notebook
- This readme file


-----------------------
Installation requisites
-----------------------

| To document the code, I used Jupyter notebook 6.0.0.
| The code is written in Python 3 (v3.6).

The following libraries were used extensively in the code:

- numpy 1.16.4
- pandas 0.25.0
- sklearn 0.21.2
- matplotlib 3.1.0
- seaborn 0.9.0


--------------------
How to use this code
--------------------

The Jupyter notebook is divided into several subsections, and markdown cells exposes the approach and the conclusions. Code cells in between are followed by their output printed.
Feel free to reuse any piece of code, or walk through the notebook to get an insight on the method and decisions taken!
